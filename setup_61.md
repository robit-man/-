## Step 1: Reflect on the human condition, 

consider the elaborate boundary conditions experienced by each individual cell under your largest organ, your beautiful flesh boundary we call skin. 

Consider the immensely unfamiliar speed of action, rates of change when bound by inertia at a small vs a large scale in relation to ourselves, 

Consider the implications of logarithms and our place in between the micro and macrocosm. 

Consider our turnover as humans, and our place as cells of the earth, a living, electrically and kinetically active feature of our universe. 

Consider the beginning and the end, the cosmic microwave background hinting at the early structures, or if following conformal cyclic cosmology, the potential that, in its gradients, lies whispters of the previous grand iteration, where the clocks (massive components) stood still upon the final handshake between hadron and event horizon. 

Now gather yourself, and perform these following tasks with great care and consideration, and please share feedback via issues!

### Install the Chromium browser

Ensure your system is up to date:
```bash
sudo apt update

### Install Nomachine Remote Desktop

Move to a directory where you want to download the file:
```bash
cd ~/Downloads
```
Use `curl` to download the package:

curl -O https://download.nomachine.com/download/8.14/Arm/nomachine_8.14.2_1_arm64.deb
```
Use `dpkg` to install the downloaded `.deb` file:
```bash
sudo dpkg -i nomachine_8.14.2_1_arm64.deb
