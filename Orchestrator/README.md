# EGG System Overview

## Introduction

The **EGG (Enhanced Gateway Gateway)** system is a comprehensive framework designed to facilitate seamless communication and data processing between various peripherals within a networked environment. It leverages modular components to handle specific tasks such as speech recognition, text-to-speech synthesis, and data routing. The core components of the EGG system include the **Orchestrator**, **ASR Engine**, **TTS Engine**, and **SLM Engine**. Each component is designed to operate independently while interacting cohesively to provide a robust and scalable solution for real-time data processing and peripheral management.

This overview provides a high-level understanding of each component, their functionalities, and how they interconnect within the EGG system. For detailed information on each component, refer to their respective [README](https://github.com/robit-man/EGG/edit/main/Orchestrator/asr/README.md) files.

## Orchestrator

### Description

The **Orchestrator** serves as the central hub of the EGG system. It manages and coordinates interactions between various peripherals, ensuring efficient data flow and task execution. The Orchestrator handles registration of peripherals, route management, and acts as the primary interface for command and control operations.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Peripheral Management**: Registers and maintains a list of active peripherals (ASR, TTS, SLM).
- **Route Management**: Defines and manages data routing paths between peripherals.
- **Command Interface**: Provides a user interface for issuing commands to peripherals.
- **Data Handling**: Receives data from peripherals and routes it to the appropriate destinations.

### Interaction with Other Components

- **Registration**: Upon startup, peripherals like ASR, TTS, and SLM register themselves with the Orchestrator.
- **Routing**: The Orchestrator defines routes that determine how data flows between peripherals.
- **Command Execution**: Users interact with the Orchestrator to control peripheral behaviors and manage data flows.

### Further Information

For detailed configuration and operational instructions, refer to the [Orchestrator README](https://github.com/robit-man/EGG/edit/main/Orchestrator/orch/README.md).

## ASR Engine

### Description

The **ASR (Automatic Speech Recognition) Engine** is responsible for converting spoken language into written text. It leverages NVIDIA's Riva ASR service to provide real-time speech-to-text capabilities, enabling voice-controlled interactions within the EGG system.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Audio Capture**: Listens to audio input from designated sources (e.g., microphone).
- **Speech Recognition**: Processes audio data through the Riva ASR API to generate transcriptions.
- **Data Transmission**: Sends recognized text data to the Orchestrator for further processing or routing.

### Interaction with Other Components

- **Registration**: Registers with the Orchestrator to announce its availability and establish communication channels.
- **Data Flow**: Receives audio input, processes it, and sends the transcribed text back to the Orchestrator.
- **Configuration**: Can be configured to adjust parameters like language code, input device, and output mode.

### Further Information

For detailed configuration and operational instructions, refer to the [ASR Engine README](https://github.com/robit-man/EGG/edit/main/Orchestrator/asr/README.md).

## TTS Engine

### Description

The **TTS (Text-to-Speech) Engine** synthesizes spoken language from written text. Utilizing NVIDIA's Riva TTS service, it enables the system to produce natural-sounding audio outputs based on textual data received from the Orchestrator or other peripherals.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Text Reception**: Receives text input from various sources (e.g., terminal, network ports).
- **Speech Synthesis**: Converts text into audio using the Riva TTS API.
- **Audio Output**: Plays synthesized audio through speakers or saves it to audio files.

### Interaction with Other Components

- **Registration**: Registers with the Orchestrator to integrate into the data routing framework.
- **Data Flow**: Receives text data, synthesizes it into speech, and outputs the audio accordingly.
- **Configuration**: Supports customization of voices, language codes, and output modes.

### Further Information

For detailed configuration and operational instructions, refer to the [TTS Engine README](https://github.com/robit-man/EGG/edit/main/Orchestrator/tts/README.md).

## SLM Engine

### Description

The **SLM (Speech Language Model) Engine** acts as an intermediary that processes and routes data between the ASR and TTS Engines and other peripherals. It utilizes language models to interpret and generate language-based responses, enhancing the system's ability to handle complex interactions and commands.

### Key Responsibilities

- **Data Routing**: Manages the flow of data between peripherals based on predefined routes.
- **Language Processing**: Uses language models to interpret commands and generate appropriate responses.
- **Communication Management**: Handles connections and data exchanges with the Orchestrator and other peripherals.

### Interaction with Other Components

- **Registration**: Registers with the Orchestrator to be recognized as an active peripheral.
- **Data Flow**: Receives data from peripherals like ASR and routes responses via TTS or other designated peripherals.
- **Configuration**: Configurable parameters allow for dynamic adjustments to routing logic and language processing behaviors.

### Further Information

For detailed configuration and operational instructions, refer to the [SLM Engine README](https://github.com/robit-man/EGG/edit/main/Orchestrator/slm/README.md).

## Interplay Between Components

The EGG system's components are designed to work in unison to provide a seamless and efficient data processing pipeline. Here's how they interact:

1. **Initialization**:
   - Each peripheral (ASR, TTS, SLM) starts by reading its configuration and registering with the Orchestrator.
   - The Orchestrator acknowledges registrations and updates its list of active peripherals.

2. **Data Flow**:
   - **ASR Engine** captures audio input, converts it to text, and sends the transcribed data to the Orchestrator.
   - **Orchestrator** receives the transcribed text and, based on defined routes, forwards it to the SLM Engine or other peripherals.
   - **SLM Engine** processes the received text, potentially interpreting commands or generating responses, and sends the output to the Orchestrator.
   - **Orchestrator** then routes the response to the TTS Engine or other designated peripherals.
   - **TTS Engine** receives the text, synthesizes it into speech, and plays it through speakers or saves it to a file.

3. **Command Execution**:
   - Users can interact with the Orchestrator to issue commands that control peripheral behaviors, adjust configurations, or modify data routing paths.
   - The Orchestrator communicates these commands to the relevant peripherals, ensuring that the system adapts to changing requirements dynamically.

4. **Configuration Management**:
   - Configuration files (`asr.cf`, `tts.cf`, `slm.cf`, `orch.cf`) allow for persistent settings that define how each component operates.
   - Command-line arguments provide flexibility to override configurations at runtime, enabling quick adjustments without modifying configuration files.

5. **Error Handling and Logging**:
   - Each component includes robust error handling to manage failures gracefully.
   - Logs are maintained for monitoring system health, diagnosing issues, and auditing data flows.
